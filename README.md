## Learning Points
This was my first time using React so I learned a ton on this project! React really challenged my thought of how a website is built, it basically took everything I was used to and through it out the window. From eliminating the need for jQuery to breaking CSS into styled components, it was a lot to get used to. Although this project did show me how using React can really eliminate a lot of headache when building a larger project, I think my biggest takeaway is that I need to remember to keep an open mind about processes, techniques and technologies because something like React that does things in ways that seem completely against the grain can have a significant impact on how quickly and how well you program.
